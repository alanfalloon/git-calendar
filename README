git-calendar
============

Ever wonder what you were working on a few months ago? Run
git-calendar, passing it all the paths to your repositories, and it
will scan all the reflogs (what is shown by 'git log -g') and it shows
you a chronological list of the projects you worked in, with the times
you made changes to your repository.

Installing
----------

git-calendar is written in Haskell, you will need to install the
Haskell Platform found at http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/

Then to build git-calendar:
> git clone git://github.com/alanfalloon/git-calendar.git
> cd git-calendar
> cabal install

That is the short version, but Cabal supports a number of options. For
more information see http://www.haskell.org/cabal/
